The criteria for this vacation is finding the preferred cities and hotels in places with the following temperature:

I decided to make a vacation itinerary in the east coast of United States of America:

- We will start our journey from Bethel in Connecticut
- 1st stop will be in Palmer City in Massachusetts
- 2nd stop will be in New Ipswich in New Hampshire
- 3rd stop will be in Bridgewater, Massachusetts

after the 3rd stop, we will then loop back to Bethel, CT
